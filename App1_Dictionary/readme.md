# Interactive English Dictionary

## Couple things about this first app
This application was built to be used as a CLI app.
myapp1.py is my verison of the application that I built while following along in tutorials
app1.py is the tutorials version of the application.
You'll notice there are some significant differences. This is because I followed my own naming convention for variables, implemented my own solution for if a user enters a proper noun or abbreviated word that could be found in the dictionary, and in general tried to stick to my own coding style while paying attention to convention.

If you would like to run this program:
1. Make sure you have your own version of python installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Open your favorite CLI and navigate to the cloned App1_Dictionary
4. Run 'python# myapp1.py' where # is optional and 3 must be used for python3

The program accepts user input for a single word (proper or otherwise) or abbreviation, checks for spelling, and then returns all definitions of the word/abbreviation to the user.

Enjoy!
