# Web Map Generation

## My second python project was creating a web map based off of data surrounding volcanoes and population density within countries around the world.

This directory contains the following:
* mymap1.py - My version of the python application that generates the web map
* MyMap1.html - The web map generated by running my python application
* app2-web-map.py - The tutorial version of the python application
* Map1.html - The web map generated by running the tutorial python application
* world.json - JSON data used to generate information within the web map

**NOTE:** My version of the application generates a different web map offering more information about individual points by using a different type of data icon, offering more information about the Volcano via an HTML iframe, and offering you a link that googles the volcano for you.

Hope you enjoy
