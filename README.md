# Welcome to learning_python_via_apps

## Couple things about this repo
- This repo exists to track the progress of my python-learning journey.
- Expect initial commits for any given app to be PRETTY scrappy.
- I may return one day to do some code cleanup, particularly after I'm some kind of python virtuoso... or I may not

If you're here, feel free to pull and check out how easy, or hard, it is to make a usable application with python

ps I'm using a Udemy course to learn python and build these apps, and so far it's a lot of fun! So, if you're interested in doing the same thing...
